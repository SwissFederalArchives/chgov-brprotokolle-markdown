## Simple search

To conduct a simple search on the start page, enter a term of your choice, which will then be searched for in all the minutes.

You can use the timeline to narrow your search down to a specific period.

## Advanced search

The fuzzy search also takes into account similar spellings of the search terms.

You can use the search in the marginalia to focus the search in the handwritten minutes on the title / subject of the decisions.

There are a range of further options for advanced searches:

- Term and phrase search (“word”; “this is a phrase”)\
Example: “Kanton Zürich”
- Wildcard search: ? (a single character), * (multiple characters), ~ (fuzzy search)\
Examples: Z?rich, Zür*, Zürich~
- Boolean operators: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)\
Examples: Kanton && Bern, Bern || Zürich, Kanton !Stadt (also: Kanton AND Bern, Bern OR Zürich, Kanton NOT Stadt)

## Result list

The results list displays the minutes in which the search term was found.

Click on the minutes to go to the first passage of text found within the selected minutes.

The search algorithm calculates relevance on the basis of the hits found per page (the more hits, the more relevant the page is). The results list consists of the pages that contain hits. It is therefore possible for a set of minutes to be listed more than once if hits are found on a number of pages within it.

## Chronological index

The decision minutes are arranged in chronological order. Searching by date allows you to access a specific set of minutes easily.

## Interactive page display (detailed view)

You consult the minutes in the [Archival IIIF](https://archival-iiif.github.io/){target="_blank"} Viewer (IIIF = [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Image_Interoperability_Framework){target="_blank"}).

The viewer is based on the browser application from [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/){target="_blank"}. It offers a range of functions to assist you:

- Parallel display of the digitised original and the automatically read text
- Line-by-line correspondence between the manuscript and the read text
- Zoom and navigate within pages
- Scroll within the document
- Jump between pages
- Search within the document
- Download the minutes as PDF files and/or the read text
