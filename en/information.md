## Data

The “Minutes of the Federal Council (1848–1974)” page includes more than 14,500 minutes of decisions. It comprises both the handwritten minutes from 1848 to 1903 and the typewritten minutes from 1904 to 1974.

## Handwritten decision minutes (1848–1903)

The texts of over 8,000 handwritten minutes have been machine-read in cooperation with the [Walter Benjamin Kolleg Digital Humanities](https://www.dh.unibe.ch/index_ger.html){target="_blank"} at the University of Bern, using the Transkribus technology. [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/de/transkribus/){target="_blank"} is an application from [READ-COOP SCE](https://readcoop.eu/de/){target="_blank"} for digitisation and AI-powered text recognition of handwritten documents.

Machine recognition of historical manuscripts is complex. The quality varies depending on the handwriting and language. The error rate for handwritten minutes is between 0.498% and 6.511% character errors, with an average of 3.35%.

## Typewritten decision minutes (1904–1974)

The read text of typewritten decision minutes also exhibits text recognition errors, but the error rate is generally lower than with handwritten minutes.
